# Hybrid-algorithm-for-CPU-Utilization-process-scheduling

This is for improving the algorithms in present for CPU scheduling for the processes
entering in the CPU. The existing round robin algorithm canâ€™t be applicable for the real time
operating system because it has higher average waiting time and turnaround time. At present
there are some algorithm which makes the hybrid of round robin, shortest job first algorithms
and round robin, priority CPU scheduling algorithms. This project introduces the concept of
creating hybrid algorithm which consist round robin, shortest job first, priority and first come
first serve algorithm. This algorithm reduces the average waiting time and turnaround time to
a considerable level.
